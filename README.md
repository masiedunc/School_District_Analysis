# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview
The school board of the City School District has requested an analysis of the performance trends of the district as well as each individual high school. They are specifically looking at the math, reading, and overall performances. Along with performance metrics, the City School District is curious to see if there are any correlations or connections between a schoolâ€™s budget and student/school performance. Due to claims of altered data, Thomas High School scores are to be re-analyzed without the 9th-grade scores to see how the changes affected the overall data and to uphold state testing standards.
