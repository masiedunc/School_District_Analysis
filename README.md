# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview
The school board of the City School District has requested an analysis of the performance trends of the district as well as each individual high school. They are specifically looking at the math, reading, and overall performances. Along with performance metrics, the City School District is curious to see if there are any correlations or connections between a schoolâ€™s budget and student/school performance. Due to claims of altered data, Thomas High School scores are to be re-analyzed without the 9th-grade scores to see how the changes affected the overall data and to uphold state testing standards. 

## Results
### District Summary
- As shown in Image 1, you can see the percentages of students passing math, passing reading, and passing overall including the Thomas High School (THS) ninth-grade scores.

  **Image 1:** *The district summary results including Thomas High School 9th grade scores.*
  
- If you refer to Image 2, where the THS ninth-grade scores are removed, you will find that the percentages of each score decreased slightly.

  **Image 2:** *The district summary results after setting Thomas High School 9th grade scores to NaNs.*
  
- When considering the size of the THS ninth-grade class, the changes in the percentage are proportionate to the 461 THS ninth-grade students compared to 39,170 students in the district.
